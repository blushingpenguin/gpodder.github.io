Extensions are gPodder's mechanism for adding optional features and allowing easy customizability. Some extensions are already activated by default if you are running a specific environment (e.g. Ubuntu Unity support in gPodder 3 is implemented as an extension).

### How To Write Your Own Extension

Extensions are a great way to customize your gPodder workflow: you'll be able to customize the UI, rename, modify or trigger
external programs when episodes are downloaded, etc..


#### Getting started

1. Extensions are loaded from the `Extensions` folder in the [gPodder Home Folder](#default-gpodder-home-folder).
The folder doesn't exist by default, so create it.

2. An example extension is available [here](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/examples/hello_world.py).
   Copy it to **GPODDER\_HOME/Extensions** and restart gPodder.

3. Extensions are activated from the **Extensions** pane of the **Preferences** dialog.
   Activate the **Hello World Extension** to get a item in the **Extras** menu called
   **Say Hello**.

4. Modify the `Message`, restart gPodder and see the updated notification when you click **Say Hello**.


#### Doing something useful

Maybe an existing extension does something similar to what you want
([rename after download](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/rename_download.py),
[tagging](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/tagging.py),
[run a command after download](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/command_on_download.py), ...).
Find inspiration in [its source code](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/tree/master/share/gpodder/extensions).

To see how an extension is loaded and every available callback, take a look at [extensions.py](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/src/gpodder/extensions.py);
every method annotated with `@call_extensions` can be overriden in your extension. Check its parameters and return type.

gPodder's [model](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/src/gpodder/model.py#L197) is quite straightforward.
Given an episode `e`:
 - get its title via `e.title`, its url via `e.url`
 - get the channel's subscription url via `e.channel.url`.


#### Debugging your extension

If your extension doesn't appear in the list,
be sure:
  - that its `__only_for__` or `__disable_in__` instructions (if any) apply to your system.
  - to run gpodder in debug mode (`gpodder -v`, [Windows](https://gpodder.github.io/docs/windows.html#debugging-gpodder-on-windows))
  and check that it's found and there isn't any error message:
```
[gpodder.extensions] DEBUG: Found extension "hello_world" in .../Extensions/hello_world.py
[gpodder.extensions] INFO: Module loaded: .../Extensions/hello_world.py

```

You should run `gpodder -v` anyway, because any log with lower priority than `logger.warn` is suppressed by default.

Feel free to ask for advice in the [mailing list](mailing-list) or as github issues:
we are always pleased to see you customize gPodder to your own needs.

Also, you may have to modify code in gPodder itself to achieve a particular goal.
This is OK: no need to recompile anything: just edit the **.py** and restart...
